                <p>It all started with one small video thanks to which I 
                    started to get involved in graphic design, video editing 
                    and programming

                Like all dudes, I was an ordinary guy who also wanted to get his own computer.
                 And on one of these days my parents gave me a computer. Well, obviously 
                 I just played and played on it, but everything changed after 
                 I started actively watching YouTube and I suddenly came across a video from Maxim Rusakov,
                 who was just starting his career as a photographer and photo edito
                 I also became interested in video editing. after 1.5 years I decided to meet an illustrator.
                 All the time I honed my skills mainly in Photoshop. All these skills helped me understand 
                 what you can think of, create, and realize your fantasies.
                 <br>
                 2 years after I started studying graphic programs, 
                 I was invited to a group of people who were involved in the VKontakte group and the YouTube channel. 
                 At that time I was a very happy person.
                 After that, I had the experience of creating memes and comedy videos.
                 After leaving the group, I was actively involved in photoshop, 
                 studied and created something new, some of the works were unusual. 
                 I was also interested in some paintings, so some of them influenced my creation.
